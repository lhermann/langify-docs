## Positions

### Translators
Translation is a time consuming job. Every job is worth one’s salt. It might be good practice to pay them.

### Printing houses
They get a complete work from us. What they have to do is layout, setting-up, printing, storing, selling. They may put the costs on the book price. We don’t have to care for them finically.

### Authors/Trustees
They invested time, too. As a result they are entitled to money.

### Platform
We devoted time to the project and have running costs.

## Options

### Open Source
Open source software may "be freely used, modified, and shared" (https://opensource.org/licenses). This works great because it is used to create a product or service where the developers earn money with. Concerning literature translations are not used to create something but rather are the product itself.

## Application
As a conclusion my suggestion is to use "Creative Commons BY NC SA" (maybe ND) as a standard so far (see question below) but to be open to any license type.

The question remains what to do with printed versions. You can print books and give them away for free, this is non commercial. You might even sell them at nor more than cost and be non commercial, I don’t know. Should have some publishing houses privileges before others?

Questions on financing: Should pay publishing houses for the right to print? Should we manage payment or a third party?

More about finances another time.
