# Authorization

This article describes the permission groups and how you become a member of them.

## Privileges

In order to be able to contribute to Langify you get more and more privileges while working if you wish. They are assigned to the permission groups and build on each other.

### 1. Reader

:chart_with_upwards_trend: 0

Everybody has the privilge to **read** the originals, the translations and comments without a user account.

### 2. Student

:chart_with_upwards_trend: 1

You just need an account to be able to set **bookmarks** and **star** your favorite works.

### 3. Contributor

:chart_with_upwards_trend: 2

Maybe you're an expert in some area and you found a mistake and wonder if you can fix it quickly. Just create an account, confirm your e-mail address and you may **improve** translations, **comment** on discussions or continue the work where others stopped and **translate** a new paragraph. Your contribution will be reviewed by another user and if it's helpful it will be published.

We ask you to support us in our aim to provide **high quality** translations. Therefore rethink what you write. Especially if you like to help but you are not so sure if you are qualified enough we recommend you to get a personal **mentor** for the beginning. He will help you out when you have questions and he will be the person who reviews your contributions without down voting.

Note that a user may lose the privilege to contribute if he repeatedly behaves inappropriate in order to prevent spamming and vandalism.

### 4. Flagger

:chart_with_upwards_trend: 5

**Report** inappropriate comments and translations to the community.

### 5. Initiator

:chart_with_upwards_trend: 10 (min. 5)

You may translate a work **nobody** else worked on **before**. A moderator may give you this privilge earlier.

### 6. Agreer

:chart_with_upwards_trend: 20

Indicate when you **agree** with a translation or a comment.

### 7. Translator

:chart_with_upwards_trend: recom. 100

Translations, improvements and comments are **applied immediately** (without reviewer). You get this privilege from a moderator.

### 8. Voter

You may **down vote** translations and comments. You get this privilege from a moderator.

### 9. Reviewer

:chart_with_upwards_trend: recom. 500

You may **review** contributors' activities. This includes comments and improvemtens of contributors who don't have the Translator privilege yet and new all translations. They have to be reviewed several times for quality reasons.  You get this privilege from a moderator.

### 10. Mentor

:chart_with_upwards_trend: recom. 1000, min. 100

Help the community grow by looking after **beginners**. You get this privilege from a moderator.

### 11. Moderator

:chart_with_upwards_trend: recom. 2000, min. 200

### 12. Guardian

:chart_with_upwards_trend: recom. 5000

You can **release different editions** of a translation after it has been proofread one or several times. Editions will get converted into different formats and are ready for printing. Guardians may act as moderators for **other areas and languages** if they have a command of the language. A Guardian may **block users** from the trustee's area or the whole website after repeated abuse of their website privileges. Trustees, proofreaders and other guardians can give this privilege.

### 13. Proofreader

:chart_with_upwards_trend: recom. 10000

You may **proofread** a translation in order to release it. Other proofreaders or trustees may provide this privilege.

### Trustee

A trustee is an organisation or person that **administers the works** of an author or publishing house.

Your **privileges** from 7 (Translator) upwards are trustee specific. That means you may have more privileges in an area than another. (They are also langauge specific.)

### Admin

An admin is part of the core staff and can act with **all privileges** where needed. This especially is the case in small communities (i.e. new langauges).

## Language

It is recommended that you contribute as a **native speaker** only or you speak the language very well. Your **privileges are langauge specific**. I.e. you start in each language from :chart_with_upwards_trend: 6 on.
