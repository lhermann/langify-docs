# Authorization

What a user is and is not allowd to do depents upon the following categories:

*   User Roll
*   Reputation

Reputation determines the privileges a user has. Reputation is langauge specific.

> DEPRICATED:
> This article describes the permission groups and how you become a member of them.

## User Rols

### Translator

Every normal user is a translator. Translators can earn :small_blue_diamond: reputation, and with reputation they **earn privileges**.

### Trustee

A trustee is an organisation or person that administers the works of an author or publishing house. Thus a trustee has **all privileges for his assigned works**. (The trustee has to assign these privileges to himself first.)

> DEPRICATED:
> Your **privileges** from 7 (Translator) upwards are trustee specific. That means you may have more privileges in an area than another. (They are also langauge specific.)

### Admin

An admin is part of the core staff and can act with **all privileges** where needed. This especially is the case in small communities (i.e. new langauges).

## Language

It is recommended that you contribute as a **native speaker** only or you speak the language very well. Your **reputation is langauge specific**. You start in each language from 5 :small_blue_diamond:. If you have reached 1000 :small_blue_diamond: in one language you will start in other languages with 50 :small_blue_diamond:.

## Privileges

### Score philosophy

* Critics of Stackoverflow point out that it is discouraging for beginners that they can hardly do anything. Therefore you should be albe to contribute as a newcomer, i.e. translate and comment. See the description of Contributor, too.
* Everybody should be albe to report abuse

### Vocabulary

Our aim is to use commonly understood terms to be intuitive.

*   approve: agree that a translation is good
*   disapprove: disagree with a translation (can remove an upvote of someone else)
*   restore: restore a previous edit/version of a segment from history and add a new record to the history
*   edit translations: doesn't really edit someone elses translation, but really creates a new translation on top of the old, visible in history
*   delete translation: remove the content and add an appropriate record to the history
*   flag: report maintainer/admin about abuse, users don't know until maintainer intervenes
*   hide: make the content of an inappropriate comment invisible (users instead see a message like "comment was hidden by maintainer", this is somethimes better for usability reasons, so the original commenter doesn't think his comment was lost, owners may always delete their comments which makes them disappear completely)

## :small_blue_diamond: Reputation
