### Criticism (Stack Overflow)

* [The decline of Stack Overflow](https://hackernoon.com/the-decline-of-stack-overflow-7cb69faa575d)

> Romanian researcher Bogdan Vasilescu criticized Stack Overflow, saying that its policies discouraged women from being actively involved while an editor from Medium said it kept maintaining a negative atmosphere for newcomers. In another report, researchers conducted empirical studies to identify what types of barriers exist for women, as well as men for posting. The study suggested that the site encourages one-upmanship, flame-wars and down-voting which makes it less likely that female users will participate. It criticised the rewards system and found instances of "gender swapping" with females adopting male or gender-neutral personas and some males masquerading as females thinking that they will not be treated as harshly.
