### Criticism (Stack Overflow)

> Romanian researcher Bogdan Vasilescu criticized Stack Overflow, saying that its policies discouraged women from being actively involved[36][why?] while an editor from Medium said it kept maintaining a negative atmosphere for newcomers.[37] In another report, researchers conducted empirical studies to identify what types of barriers exist for women, as well as men for posting.[38] The study suggested that the site encourages one-upmanship, flame-wars and down-voting which makes it less likely that female users will participate. It criticised the rewards system and found instances of "gender swapping" with females adopting male or gender-neutral personas and some males masquerading as females thinking that they will not be treated as harshly.
