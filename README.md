# Langify

Documentation for the open translation system Langify

Langify is under development. You may have a look at our status quo below. Feel free to share your thoughts in the _issues_ section.


## Our aim

Provide an online platform to read and translate books and articles easily with a community that shares the same passion.


## Core features

Edior, social components.


## Principles

Our focus in development.


## Translations

There will be one translation for each langauge. It will be defined in which locale it should be written.

Future plans: We might add one translation per locale (e.g. British and American English). We might also allow two translations, one which is very exact and one which emphasizes a beautiful language (we also have e.g. different bible translationsfor that reason).


## Accounts

**Username**: Publicly visible, therefore don't use your e-mail address.

**First and last name**: Your real name. Please understand that official translations need official names. You can choose between _public_, _contributors_ and _reference_. When you select _contributors_ it is visible to registered contributors, when you select _reference_ it is used for reference, e.g. in printed books, only.


## Versioning

[Editions, releases and drafts](versioning.md).

## Authorization and reward system

[Read](authorization.md) about reputation, badges and privileges in order to produce high quality translations.
